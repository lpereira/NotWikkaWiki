/**
 * Override control: relocate or share Wikka components between installations.
 *
 * This file allows the administrator to override standard or default paths used
 * by Wikka. This makes it possible to:
 * - locate the site configuration file outside the webroot for security
 * - share Wikka code between several Wikka sites running on the same server
 * - share Wikka language files between several Wikka sites running on the same
 *   server: useful if you make adaptations to the texts or add a new translation
 * - use an already-installed 3rd-party component from its own location instead
 *   of the one bundled with Wikka
 *
 * To use an override, uncomment the corresponding define and adapt the path
 * to reflect your situation.
 *
 * There are two types of overrides:
 * - Direct overrides will be used directly by Wikka
 * - Configuration overrides define a <b>default</b> value for the configuration,
 *   which may be changed during installation or later by modifying the site
 *   configuration file. By using the overrides here you can provide consistent
 *   setup values for a collection of Wikka installations
 * 
 * Naming indicates purpose:
 * - All constants have a prefix "LOCAL": LOCAL' in this context means applicable
 *   to this particular instance of Wikka, although it these constants can
 *   actually be used to share system files between different installations, by
 *   pointing this all at the same location in all instances.
 * - Constant names ending in "_PATH" define a <b>filesystem directory</b>; they
 *   should not end in a (back)slash
 * - Constant names ending in "_CONFIGFILE" define a <b>filesystem path</b> for a
 *   configuration file; LOCAL_SITE_CONFIGFILE is for the site configuration file
 *   and does not need to exist before installation.
 * - Constant names ending in "_URIPATH" define a <b>URI path component</b> to
 *   be used by Wikka to build a fully-qualified URL; they should not end in
 *   a slash.
 *
 * Tip 1:
 * When defining <b>filesystem paths</b>, you can use relative, absolute, or
 * fully_qualified paths (with a drive letter on Windows).
 * You may also use a (normal) slash instead of a backslash on a Windows server:
 * Wikka canonicalizes the paths, which automatically provides the slash type
 * appropriate for the system it's running on.
 *
 * Tip 2:
 * When defining <b>URI path components</b>, you can use the little "Compatibility"
 * function <b>filesys2uri()</b> to convert any backslashes in an already-built
 * or default filesystem path into forward slashes to use as a URI path.
